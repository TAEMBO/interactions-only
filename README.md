My personal HTTP-based interactions-only user-installed Discord utility bot made in TypeScript. Contains various functions and commands that I personally find useful. Cloned from [interaction-only][interaction-only]. Proper disciplines and conventions not guarenteed. Much inspiration taken from the discord.js community.
